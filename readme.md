# ES6 Slack Snippet Posting

App/Integration that allows user to type slash commands in slack, and have a bot DM them with a snippet of example code on that feature.

Source for the snippets comes from https://github.com/DrkSephy/es6-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md#destructuring.

##Â Setup/Usage

I have it currently setup on a test slack team - message me and I can help you get it setup for your own team.
